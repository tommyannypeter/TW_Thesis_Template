\chapter{The Results}
\label{chap:result}
The binned likelihood approach is used to get the final fitting result. The data are binned into four regions in $E^{miss}_T$ ($p^V_T$ in CR) to fit simultaneously, three for the resolved region, $[150\, \mathrm{GeV}, 200\, \mathrm{GeV})$, $[200\, \mathrm{GeV}, 350\, \mathrm{GeV})$ and $[350\, \mathrm{GeV}, 500\, \mathrm{GeV})$, and one for the merged region, $[500\, \mathrm{GeV}, \infty)$. For the SR, the mass of the Higgs boson candidate $m_h$ is the fit variable. For the background estimation, the charge of $\mu$ is used as the discriminating variable in one-muon CR to separate $W$($\mu\nu$) + jets and $t\bar{t}$. The $t\bar{t}$ is expected to have equivalent $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$, while the $W$ + jets process is expected to have more $\mu^+$ than $\mu^-$. In the two-lepton CR, the total yield is used as the fit variable. The jets containing $b$- or $c$-quarks, expressed as heavy flavor jets (HF), dominate in the main background. The normalization of $Z$ + HF, $W$ + HF and $t\bar{t}$ is free parameters in the fit and the different flavor composition between the two jets, like $bb$, $bc$, $bl$ ($l$ for light quarks) and $cc$ provides the systematic uncertainties. The normalization factors of $Z$ + HF, $W$ + HF and $t\bar{t}$ are fitted to be $1.42 \pm 0.10$, $1.51 \pm 0.22$ and $1.10 \pm 0.08$, respectively. For the sub-dominant background, the MC simulation is constrained by theory prediction.

Thanks to the application of the VR track jets, the object-based $E^{miss}_T$ significance, as well as the increased luminosity, the result of the analysis becomes further improved, as shown in \cref{fig:VRvsFR}. The distribution of $E^{miss}_T$ for the SR, including the resolved region and merged region combined, is shown in \cref{fig:result-MET-mass} and no significant excess is observed. The results are further interpreted as exclusion limits at 95\% confidence level (CL). The exclusion contour of the $Z^\prime$-2HDM parameters $(m_{Z^\prime}, m_A)$ is depicted in \cref{fig:result-limit} and the observation is consistent with the expectation\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-039}.

Other differences between the two analyses also include the application of the object-based $E^{miss}_T$. Obvious improvement is shown in the high $m_{Z^\prime}$ region.]

The solid histogram and the blue dashed line in the upper panel present the comparison between the data and the SM prediction after and before the fit, respectively. The expected $Z^\prime$-2HDM signal is also shown by the red dashed line. The lower panel shows the ratio of the data to the post-fit SM prediction. No significant excess is observed.]

The observation is consistent with the expectation within the uncertainty. The previous ATLAS result is also shown.]
