\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I thank Prof. Pai-Hsien Jennifer Hsu, Dr. Patrick Rieck and Dr. Samuel Meehan for giving me chance to participate this project.

I also appreciate Dr. Philipp and Dr. Yun-Ju Lu for giving me a lot of opinions and help when I encountered programming difficulties.

At last, I'm grateful Cheng-Hsin Han because he is a nice partner.
