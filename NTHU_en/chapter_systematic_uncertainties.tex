\chapter{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{chap:systematic_uncertainties}
The dominant systematic uncertainties originate from the experimental $b$-tagging efficiency, some theoretical modeling of the signal and the background processes, the MC statistics and the luminosity. The uncertainty of $b$-tagging efficiency is mainly from the calibration of the flavor tagging efficiency of $t\bar{t}$ events \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-013} \cite{1512.01094}. The uncertainty of the modeling is from the processes of $V$ + jets, $t\bar{t}$, SM Higgs boson decaying to $b\bar{b}$ associated with a vector boson ($VH(bb)$) and diboson for the most part, which is derived in the SM $VH(bb)$ analysis \cite{Pandini:2111370} \cite{Robson:2235887}. By and large, the theoretical uncertainties are performed by following the strategy in \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-036}. The luminosity uncertainty is obtained from calibrations of the luminosity scale \cite{Aaboud2016}.
