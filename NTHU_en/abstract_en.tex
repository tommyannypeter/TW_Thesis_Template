\chapter{Abstract}
In the search for the dark matter of the $Z^\prime$-2HDM model produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to $b\bar{b}$, the $Z$($\nu\nu$) + jets is the main background process. The thesis shows the estimation of the background with the $Z$($ll$) + jets process which has similar kinematics with the shape uncertainty. In the end, the thesis presents the improvement of the analysis compared to the previous iteration. The result of the analysis is interpreted as exclusion limits of the model at 95\% confidence level.
