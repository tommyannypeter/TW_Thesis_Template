\chapter{Abstract}
In the search for the dark matter of the $Z^\prime$-2HDM model produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to $b\bar{b}$, the kinematics of $Z \to ll$ are used to estimate $Z \to \nu\nu$, the main background of the process in the post-fit stage. Instead of using the ratio of the $Z \to \nu\nu$ decay channel to $Z \to ll$ decay channel based on the previous analysis, this thesis presents the improvement of the analysis by using the ratio of the updated Monte-Carlo (MC) samples of the $Z$ boson.
