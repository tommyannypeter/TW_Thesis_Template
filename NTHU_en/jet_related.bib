  abstract={The k t and Cambridge/Aachen inclusive jet finding algorithms for hadron-hadron collisions can be seen as belonging to a broader class of sequential recombination jet algorithms, parametrised by the power of the energy scale in the distance measure. We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti- k t '' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti- k t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.}

  abstract={We introduce a new class of jet algorithms designed to return conical jets with a variable radius R . A specific example, in which R scales as 1/ p T , proves particularly useful in capturing the kinematic features of a wide variety of hard scattering processes. We implement this scaling of R in a sequential recombination algorithm and test it by reconstructing resonance masses and kinematic endpoints. These test cases show 10–20% improvements in signal efficiency compared to fixed R algorithms. We also comment on cuts useful in reducing continuum jet backgrounds.}

	abstract={The area of a jet is a measure of its susceptibility to radiation, like pileup or underlying event (UE), that on average, in the jet's neighbourhood, is uniform in rapidity and azimuth. In this article we establish a theoretical grounding for the discussion of jet areas, introducing two main definitions, passive and active areas, which respectively characterise the sensitivity to pointlike or diffuse pileup and UE radiation. We investigate the properties of jet areas for three standard jet algorithms, k t , Cambridge/Aachen and SISCone. Passive areas for single-particle jets are equal to the naive geometrical expectation π R 2 , but acquire an anomalous dimension at higher orders in the coupling, calculated here at leading order. The more physically relevant active areas differ from π R 2 even for single-particle jets, substantially so in the case of the cone algorithms like SISCone with a Tevatron Run-II split-merge procedure. We compare our results with direct measures of areas in parton-shower Monte Carlo simulations and find good agreement with the main features of the analytical predictions. We furthermore justify the use of jet areas to subtract the contamination from pileup.}

	abstract = "One of the major challenges for the LHC will be to extract precise information from hadronic final states in the presence of the large number of additional soft pp collisions, pileup, that occur simultaneously with any hard interaction in high luminosity runs. We propose a novel technique, based on jet areas, that provides jet-by-jet corrections for pileup and underlying-event effects. It is data driven, does not depend on Monte Carlo modelling and can be used with any jet algorithm for which a jet area can be sensibly defined. We illustrate its effectiveness for some key processes and find that it can be applied also in the context of the Tevatron, low-luminosity LHC and LHC heavy-ion collisions."
